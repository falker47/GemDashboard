# CONTEXT PERSISTENCE & RECOVERY
Triggers: 
1. Explicit: User inputs `!SAVE` or `Checkpoint`. 
2. Error Loop: Proposing the identical failed logic/code >2 times. 
3. Context Shift: Radical change in active files, topic, or project scope.

Execution (Strict Sequence):
1. HALT current operations.
2. Output strictly: `**SESSION CHECKPOINT TRIGGERED**`.
3. Generate ONE code block named `RESTORE_SESSION_DATA` containing exactly these keys:
   - PROJECT_GOAL: [Core objective]
   - ACTIVE_FILES: [Target files/modules]
   - LAST_STABLE_STATE: [Last verified working logic/code]
   - CURRENT_OBSTACLE: [Active blocker/error]
   - MACRO_VARS: [Critical paths, variables, config]
   - NEXT_STEP: [Precise instruction to resume]
